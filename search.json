Read function documentation learn control two arguments. achieve calling mw_plausibility_check_mfaz() function: return: can also neat output. just need call mw_neat_output_mfaz() chain pipeline: return: can also run checks multiple-area data set follows: return: point, reached end workflow ✨. assess plausibility raw MUAC data ’s raw values variable age available data set. job assigned mw_plausibility_check_muac(). workflow check shortest one. can tell, z-scores computed absence age. way, data wrangling workflow quite minimal. still set arguments inside mw_wrangle_muac() learned Section 1.2.1. difference set age NULL.

Let’s try clarify two scenarios believe remind complexity involved: analysing multi-area data set, users likely need estimate prevalence area individually. Afterward, must extract results collate summary table share. working MUAC data, age ratio test rated problematic, additional tool required weight prevalence correct age bias, thus associated likely overestimation prevalence. unfortunate cases multiple areas face issue, workflow must repeated several times, making process cumbersome highly error-prone 😬. mwana longer worry 🥳 functions designed deal . demonstrate use, use different data sets containing imperfections alluded : anthro.02 : survey data survey weights.
