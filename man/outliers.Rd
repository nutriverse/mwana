\title{Identify and flag outliers}
\usage{
flag_outliers(x, .from = c("zscores", "raw_muac"))

remove_flags(x, .from = c("zscores", "raw_muac"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of class \code{numeric} of WFHZ or MFAZ or raw MUAC values.
The latter should be in millimeters.}

\item{.from}{A choice between \code{zscores} and \code{raw_muac} for where outliers should be
detected and flagged from.}
}
\value{
A vector of the same length as \code{x} of flagged observations that are
outliers: 1 for is a flag and 0 is not a flag.
}
\description{
Outliers are extreme values that deviate remarkably from the survey mean, making
them unlikely to be accurate measurements. This function identifies and signals
them based on a criterion set for the WFHZ, the MFAZ and for the absolute MUAC
values. For the raw MUAC values, outliers are identified and flagged using
a different approach as described below.
}
\details{
The flagging criterion used for the WFHZ and the MFAZ is as in
\href{https://smartmethodology.org/}{SMART plausibility check}. A fixed flagging
criterion is used for the raw MUAC values. This is as recommended by
\href{https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13478}{Bilukha, O., & Kianian, B. (2023).}
}
\examples{

## Sample data for raw MUAC values ----
x <- anthro.01$muac

## Apply the function with type set to "raw_muac" ----
flag_outliers(x, .from = "raw_muac")

## Sample data for MFAZ or for WFHZ values ----
x <- anthro.02$mfaz

# Apply the function with type set to "zscores" ----
flag_outliers(x, .from = "zscores")

## With .from set to "zscores" ----
remove_flags(wfhz.01$wfhz, .from = "zscores")

## With .from set to "absolute" ----
remove_flags(mfaz.01$muac, .from = "raw_muac")

}
