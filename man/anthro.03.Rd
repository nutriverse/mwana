\description{
\code{anthro.03} contains survey data of four districts. Each district's dataset
presents distinct data quality scenarios that requires tailored prevalence
analysis approach: two districts show a problematic WFHZ standard deviation
whilst the remaining are all within range.

This sample data demonstrates the use of prevalence functions on multi-area
survey data, where there is variations in the standard deviation rating.
As a result, different analyses approaches are required for each area
to ensure accurate estimation.
