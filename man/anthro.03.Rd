\description{
\code{anthro.03} contains survey data of four districts. Each district data set
presents distinct data quality scenarios that requires tailored prevalence
analysis approach: two districts show a problematic WFHZ standard deviation
whilst the remaining are all within range.

This sample data is useful to demonstrate the use of the prevalence functions on
a multiple-area survey data where there can be variations in the rating of
acceptability of the standard deviation, hence require different analyses approaches
for each area to ensure accurate estimation.
