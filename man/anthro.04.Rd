\description{
\code{anthro.04} was generated from a community-based sentinel site survey
conducted across three provinces. Each province's dataset presents distinct
data quality scenarios, requiring tailored prevalence analysis.
"Province 3" has problematic MFAZ standard deviation and age ratio tests.
"Province 2" shows a problematic age ratio but acceptable MFAZ standard
deviation. Lastly, "Province 1" has both tests within acceptable ranges.

This sample data demonstrates the use of prevalence functions on multi-area
survey data, where variations in the standard deviation ratings exist.
As a result, different analytical approaches are required for each area
to ensure accurate interpretation.
