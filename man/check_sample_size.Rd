\title{Check IPC AMN Sample Size Requirements}
\usage{
check_sample_size(df, .group, .data_type = c("survey", "screening", "ssite"))
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the required variables.}

\item{.group}{A vector containing the ID's of the primary sampling unit.
Usually and ideally a numeric vector, but sometimes this variables may come as
a character vector. Either way, \code{check_sample_size()} will execute
the task accordingly.}

\item{.data_type}{The data collection method: survey, screening or sentinel sites.
If you wish to check IPC AMN requirements on surveys were met, set
method = "survey"; for screening set method = "screening" and for sentinel
sites set method = "ssite". If by mistake a different parameter is given,
an error will be thrown and the function will stop, but with a guidance on
how to go about.}
}
\value{
\code{check_sample_size()} returns an output of the same type
as the input (data frame), but of a different size. By default, the function
returns a summary of length 1 (one row), but with three new columns added to
the input data frame: \code{groups} (for survey), or sites (for screening or sentinel
sites) \code{n_obs} and \code{meet_ipc}. The first will store the total number of PSUs
in the sample. \code{n_obs} will store the total number of rows/observations and
\code{meet_ipc} is a logical vector to say whether or not the IPC AMN minimum
criteria for sample size was met. This is flexible according to the method you
select with \code{.data_type = " "}.

\description{
Evidence used in \href{https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/resources/ipc-manual/en/}{IPC}
comes from different sources, collected in different ways,
namely: representative surveys, screenings or even data from community-based
surveillance system - the sentinel sites. IPC AMN protocols have set minimum
sampling a sample size requirements for each. For cluster-based
representative surveys, there must be at least 25 primary sampling unit (PSUs).
On screening, there ware two ways: i. exhaustive screening (door-to-door) or
ii. sampled screening. For this, there should be at least three sites (i.e.,
villages or communities, etc). \code{check_sample_size()} checks the
on sampled screening.

\code{check_sample_size()} helps you know if your data meets the at least
IPC AMN minimum requirements. This function should be used before proceeding
to checking the quality of measurements. Doing this saves you from avoid
working on data that do not meet the minimum requirements, as it will not be
used in any IPC analysis.
