\title{Identify Flags in the Dataset using MUAC-for-age MFAZ z-score and Crude MUAC}
\usage{
add_flags(x, method = c("mfaz", "muac"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric value from the variable storing MFAZ or crude MUAC's
observations in the dataset, as applicable.}

\item{method}{The method you wish \code{add_flags()} to identify flags on. A choice
between "mfaz" and "muac". If you wish to get flags for MFAZ set
\code{method = "mfaz"}. If your wish to get flags for crude MUAC, set
\code{method = "muac"}. The default is "mfaz". If by mistake a different option
is supplied, an error will be thrown with a message guiding you what to do.}
}
\value{
A vector of two values: 1 and 0, where 1 signifies flagged value and
0 not flagged.
}
\description{
This function is designed to flag MFAZ and crude MUAC-based values if the fall
outside outside Â±3 from the observed survey sample mean and a fixed range of
<100mm and >200mm for MFAZ and crude MUAC respectively. This is based on the
research findings by \href{https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13478}{Bilukha, O., & Kianian, B. (2023) .}
}
\examples{
 # Sample data of crude MUAC
 x <- c(90, 110, 140, 200, 119, 235)
 # Apply `add_flags()` with method set to "muac"
 add_flags(x, method = "muac")

 # Sample data of MFAZ
 x <- c(-2.265, -5.275, -0.72, -2.261, -2.264, -4.451, -2.261, -1.828)
 # Apply `add_flags()` with method set to "mfaz"
 add_flags(x, method = "mfaz")
