Description: The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) for Acute 
    Malnutrition is a global tool used for classifying the severity of areas 
    based on the acute malnutrition. An IPC AMN product is primarily used to 
    inform countries Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) of the Humanitarian 
    Programme Cycle (HPC). The accepted sources of evidence on prevalence of 
    acute malnutrition varies from surveys, rapid assessments (mostly based on 
    MUAC), including sentinel sites. According to the IPC AMN protocols, 
    every evidence must be subject to quality checks to ascertain their 
    reliability and decided whether to use or not. This package provides useful 
    functions and utilities that supports IPC AMN-related data analysis check.
