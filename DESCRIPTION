Description: The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) for
    Acute Malnutrition is a global tool used to classify geographical
    areas based on the prevalence of acute malnutrition. An IPC AMN
    product is primarily used to inform countries Humanitarian Needs
    Overview (HNO) of the Humanitarian Programme Cycle (HPC). The accepted
    sources of evidence on prevalence of acute malnutrition varies from
    surveys, community-based screenings and sent- inel sites. According to
    the IPC AMN protocols, every evidence must be subject to quality
    checks to ascertain their reliability and decided whether to use or
    not. This package provides useful functions and utilities that
    supports IPC AMN-related data analysis check.
